# Using Machine Learning Techniques to Determine the Value of Records

This project didn't start with a hypothesis. All I knew was the website from which I scraped the data was a rich source of 
information, and I'd figure out a use for it later and hopefully make some discoveries on the way.

I had theories that older vinyls would be more expensive given their antique status, and that I'd see huge differences between
rock and electronic music, the latter of which disproved. The most logical factor determining price was a measure of supply 
& demand, which turned out to be more influential than I thought.

I've ultimately ended up with a tool that creates a list of underpriced records. The next logical step is to create a 
web-app to use while browsing/purchasing from the website.
